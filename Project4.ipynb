    "<P>Please address (minimum 200 words) the following questions in the space below. As the article describes, \"common wisdom among programmers is to develop a pure algorithm that does not incorporate protected attributes into the model,\" where protected classes may include aspects such as race, gender, age, sexual orientation, and disability status. As a result, the algorithms can be bias. How might algorithms be evaluated for bias? Are there machine learning applications where you would sacrifice accuracy in order to reduce bias? Are there machine learning applications where you would allow bias in order to increase accuracy?</P>"

    "Generally, I think that the developers of algorithms should attempt to reduce bias between groups of different protected classes while compromising the performance of the model as little as possible. I prioritize reducing bias because I believe that most often, the groups that will be disproportionately endangered by biased algorithms will be those that are already most at risk in society. I believe that there are several ways to evaluate algorithms for bias: First, we can examine how an algorithm performs on more diverse sets of testing data. In doing so, it is important to protect the privacy of diverse people represented in the data and ensure that their information cannot be traced back to them. Furthermore, we can also adjust our model to explore more complex relationships in data that might require it to go beyond a surface-level understanding of patterns involving complex human characteristics. I would sacrifice accuracy to reduce bias in issues that are more interpersonal in nature but don't have an underlying premise of improving safety: for instance, hiring. Conversely, I would allow for some bias in applications where immediate safety is directly concerned. Nonetheless, I remain concerned that if we allow for only the majority to be protected by our algorithms, we risk harming already vulnerable populations."

    "<P>To begin, read in the <code>training.csv</code> file containing <em>training</em> data. Unlike many other <code>CSV</code> files that we have worked with previously, the data are not in matrix form (rows and columns) here, but rather a list. Each line in the file contains three comma delimited values: the first corresponds to the ID of a person (user), the second correspond to the ID of a business (item), and the third corresponds to the rating (1 through 5) that the person gave the business in a review. The file contains over 80,000 lines, i.e., over 80,000 ratings that people gave to businesses. Write code below to create a user-item matrix, as described in class, from the data in the file. For each line in the file, you can think of the user (person) ID as indicating the row in the user-item matrix, the item (business) ID as indicating the column in the user-item matrix, and the rating as the value to be inserted in the user-item matrix at the specified row and column. Note that your user-item matrix will have many more than 80,000 entries even though the data contain only ~80,000 ratings. Thus, the matrix will be sparse, i.e., most values in the matrix should correspond to zero since each person rates only a small subset of all businesses.</P>"

The file <code>test_reviews.txt</code> contains 400 lines, one for each user, where each line contains a user's ID followed by a tab followed by the text of all the user's reviews concatenated together. The file <code>test_business.txt</code> also contains 400 lines, one for each user, where each line contains a user's ID followed by a tab followed by a tab delimited list of business IDs for the businesses that the user has reviewed. Below, write code to read in the data from the two files, <code>test_reviews.txt</code> and <code>test_business.txt</code>. For the text of users' reviews, you should featurize the text using the <code>TfidVectorizer</code> that you instantiated and trained above, so that you will have matrix (array) with 400 rows (one per user) and over 2 million columns (corresponding to the bi-gram features). <em>HINT: once again, it is recommended that after invoking the <code>transform</code> function on a <code>TfidfVectorizer</code> that you use the returned sparse matrix for efficiency reasons and not convert the matrix to a <code>numpy</code> array using the <code>toarray<code> function.</em></P>"
